      "<bos> what then are the distinctive characters of the republican form were an answer to this question to be sought not by recurring to principles but in the application of the term by political writers to the constitution of different states no satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified with the same appellation the government of england which has one republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political disquisitions,\"O , , O O O O O O O ?

      "<bos> if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established we may define a republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure for a limited period or during good behavior it is essential to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient for such a government that the persons administering it be appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified otherwise every government in the united states as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican character according to the constitution of every state in the union some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode of appointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a definite period and in many instances both within the legislative and executive departments to a period of years according to the provisions of most of the constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behavior,\"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O .

      "<bos> on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly derived from the choice of the people according to the example in most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the union will as in the several states be the choice though a remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of two years as in the state of south carolina the senate is elective for the period of six years which is but one year more than the period of the senate of maryland and but two more than that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in south carolina for two years in the other states the election is annual in several of the states however no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office the president of the united states is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of the case and the example of the state constitutions,\"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O .

(Again, the final softmax has been absorbed into the loss function so you don't need to implement that.) Note that we added bias vectors $b_h$ and $b_o$ in this lab since we are training very small models. (In large models, having a bias vector matters a lot less.) In this part, you should implement the RNN from scratch and *not* use `nn.RNN`. We'll make use of this convenient PyTorch module in the next part. \n",

    "\n",
    "By using this formulation, our code becomes more efficient, since `nn.RNN` is highly optimized. Besides, we can use bi-directional RNNs by simply passing `bidirectional=True` to the RNN constructor.\n",
