Return address at:
5FDCD0

EBP:
5FDCCC

BUFFER AT (Source):
5F9D20

BUFFER COPIED TO AT (Destination):
5FDCD8 == EBP+12

args we want to push for send_commands_to_server:
arg1 = socket ([ebp+8])
arg2 = 7
arg3 = some_buffer which scanf be called before to fill it with the command for PEEK
arg4 = address of offset Buffer for server communication (0x62508080)
arg5 = 0

ESP when need to get socket = 5FD8C0
Old EBP = 7CFD5F00 (little endian)
